# 100 Days of Python
![100days-course](https://github.com/Dishantkharkar/100_Days_OF_Python/assets/130529528/d04110ac-3526-4d78-a9a5-9cff63ba10ae)


Welcome to my "100 Days of Python" challenge! In this repository, you'll find my daily progress as I embark on a journey to learn Python from scratch. Each day, I'll be working on various Python concepts, projects, and exercises, and I'll be documenting my learning process right here.

## What to Expect

- **Daily Jupyter Notebooks**: You will find Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for each day's work. These notebooks will contain code snippets, explanations, and exercises related to the Python topics I'm studying that day.

- **Topics Covered**: I will start with the basics, including variables, data types, loops, and conditionals (if-else statements). As the days progress, I will delve into more advanced topics such as functions, object-oriented programming, data structures, and more.

- **Projects**: I will also work on small Python projects to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios. You can check out these projects in the "Projects" directory.

- **Notes**: I'll be sharing my notes and insights in the "Notes" directory. These notes will summarize key concepts and serve as a reference for myself and others.
