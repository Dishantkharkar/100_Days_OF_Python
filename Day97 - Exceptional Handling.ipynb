    "\n",
    "3. **Possible Security Risks:**\n",
    "   - Improperly handled exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities in your code. It is crucial to handle exceptions carefully and avoid exposing too much information about your program to mitigate potential security risks.\n"
