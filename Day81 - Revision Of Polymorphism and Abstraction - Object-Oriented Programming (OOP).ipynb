    "## **Abstraction**\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects, while ignoring or hiding the non-essential details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, abstraction allows you to create a simplified representation of an object or system that focuses on what's relevant to your application and hides the unnecessary complexity. Here are some key aspects of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modeling:** Abstraction involves defining classes and objects that capture the essential characteristics and behaviors of real-world entities or concepts. You create classes to represent these abstractions, defining their attributes (data) and methods (behavior) to interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hiding Complexity:** Abstraction allows you to hide the internal details and complexities of an object's implementation from the outside world. This is achieved through encapsulation, where you define private attributes and provide public methods to interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generalization:** Abstraction often involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of attributes and behaviors shared by multiple related classes. This promotes code reusability and flexibility through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Focus on What, Not How:** When you work with abstractions, you can focus on using objects based on what they do (their methods) rather than how they do it (their implementation details). This separation of concerns simplifies the design and maintenance of complex systems.\n",
