    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is supported in Python, just like in many other object-oriented languages. It refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. Additionally, it restricts direct access to some of the object's components, providing a controlled and well-defined interface to interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers and naming conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public:** Attributes and methods that are accessible from outside the class without any restrictions. By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected:** Attributes and methods that are intended to be used only within the class and its subclasses. In Python, you can denote a protected attribute or method by prefixing it with a single underscore (e.g., `_my_attribute`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private:** Attributes and methods that are intended to be used only within the class. In Python, you can denote a private attribute or method by prefixing it with a double underscore (e.g., `__my_attribute`).\n",

    "In a bustling city, there was a high-tech security system protecting a valuable treasure. The system had a keypad (public interface) that allowed authorized personnel to enter a secret code. Behind the keypad was a locked room (protected layer) with advanced security features, and inside that room was a safe (private layer) holding the treasure. Only a select few knew the secret code, ensuring the treasure's safety while providing access to those who needed it. This is encapsulation in action, safeguarding valuable data while allowing controlled access."

    "### Top five benefits of encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Controlled Access:** Encapsulation restricts direct access to internal data, ensuring that it is only modified through well-defined methods, which helps prevent unintended errors and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity:** Encapsulation promotes modular code by isolating the implementation details of a class. This makes it easier to update or replace components without affecting the rest of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Hiding:** It hides complex internal details, reducing the complexity for users of a class and allowing developers to change the implementation without impacting external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security:** By controlling access to sensitive data and methods, encapsulation enhances security, reducing the risk of unauthorized or malicious manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reusability:** Encapsulation facilitates the creation of reusable and self-contained classes, which can be easily integrated into different parts of a program or shared across projects, saving development time and effort."

    "## Common uses of encapsulation in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Protection:** Encapsulation restricts direct access to data, ensuring that it can only be modified through controlled methods. This protects data integrity and prevents unintended modifications or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction:** It allows you to present a simplified and high-level view of an object, hiding the complex implementation details. This abstraction makes it easier for users of the class to understand and work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Organization:** Encapsulation helps organize code by bundling related data and methods within a class. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security:** By encapsulating sensitive data and operations, you can control who has access to them. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of critical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reusability:** Encapsulated classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in different projects. This reusability saves development time and promotes the creation of robust, well-tested components."
