    "In Python 2, there were two functions for creating sequences of numbers: `range()` and `xrange()`. However, in Python 3, the `xrange()` function was removed, and `range()` was optimized to behave like `xrange()` from Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`range()`**:\n",
    "   - It returns a list containing a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "   - It generates the entire sequence and stores it in memory.\n",
    "   - This can be inefficient for large ranges because it consumes a significant amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`xrange()`**:\n",
    "   - It returns an xrange object, which is an iterator that generates numbers on-the-fly.\n",
    "   - It is more memory-efficient for large ranges because it generates numbers as needed and doesn't store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `xrange()` function is no longer available. The `range()` function in Python 3 was modified to behave like `xrange()` from Python 2, meaning it is an iterator and generates values on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in Python 3, you can use `range()` for creating sequences, and it will be memory-efficient like `xrange()` in Python 2. The use of `xrange()` is no longer necessary in Python 3."
