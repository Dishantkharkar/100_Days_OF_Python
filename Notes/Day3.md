1. **If-Else Statements**:
   - Used to create conditional branches in Python code.
   - `if`, `elif`, and `else` are used to define conditions and execute code based on those conditions.
   - Provides a way to handle different scenarios in your code.

2. **Example of If-Else**:
   - Demonstrated a login program where the user enters their email and password.
   - Used if-else statements to check if the input matches the stored email and password.
   - Provided a welcome message on successful login and handled incorrect password input.

3. **Nested If-Else Statements**:
   - Showed how to nest if-else statements inside one another.
   - Nested if-else statements allow for more complex conditional logic.
   - Illustrated with an example involving multiple conditions.

4. **Modules in Python**:
   - Modules are files containing Python code that can be reused in other scripts or programs.
   - Python's standard library contains numerous built-in modules for various purposes.
   - Demonstrated the use of the `math`, `keyword`, `random`, and `datetime` modules.
   - Mentioned the `help('modules')` command to list all available modules in Python.
